    /* Not done:

       No attempt is made to identify an overlap u==v.  The result will be
       correct (1.0), but a full actual division is done whereas of course
       x/x==1 needs no work.  Such a call is not a sensible thing to make, and
       it's left to an application to notice and optimize if it might arise
       somehow through pointer aliasing or whatever.

       Enhancements:

       The high quotient limb is non-zero when high{up,vsize} >= {vp,vsize}.  We
       could make that comparison and use qsize==prec instead of qsize==prec+1,
       to save one limb in the division.

       If r==u but the size is enough bigger than prec that there won't be an
       overlap between quotient and dividend in mpn_div_q, then we can avoid
       copying up,usize.  This would only arise from a prec reduced with
       mpf_set_prec_raw and will be pretty unusual, but might be worthwhile if
       it could be worked into the copy_u decision cleanly.  */
