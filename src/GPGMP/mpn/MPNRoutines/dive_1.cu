    /* Divide a={src,size} by d=divisor and store the quotient in q={dst,size}.
      q will only be correct if d divides a exactly.

      A separate loop is used for shift==0 because n<<GMP_LIMB_BITS doesn't
      give zero on all CPUs (for instance it doesn't on the x86s).  This
      separate loop might run faster too, helping odd divisors.

      Possibilities:

      gpmpn_divexact_1c could be created, accepting and returning c.  This would
      let a long calculation be done piece by piece.  Currently there's no
      particular need for that, and not returning c means that a final umul can
      be skipped.

      Another use for returning c would be letting the caller know whether the
      division was in fact exact.  It would work just to return the carry bit
      "c=(l>s)" and let the caller do a final umul if interested.

      When the divisor is even, the factors of two could be handled with a
      separate gpmpn_rshift, instead of shifting on the fly.  That might be
      faster on some CPUs and would mean just the shift==0 style loop would be
      needed.

      If n<<GMP_LIMB_BITS gives zero on a particular CPU then the separate
      shift==0 loop is unnecessary, and could be eliminated if there's no great
      speed difference.

      It's not clear whether "/" is the best way to handle size==1.  Alpha gcc
      2.95 for instance has a poor "/" and might prefer the modular method.
      Perhaps a tuned parameter should control this.

      If src[size-1] < divisor then dst[size-1] will be zero, and one divide
      step could be skipped.  A test at last step for s<divisor (or ls in the
      even case) might be a good way to do that.  But if this code is often
      used with small divisors then it might not be worth bothering  */
