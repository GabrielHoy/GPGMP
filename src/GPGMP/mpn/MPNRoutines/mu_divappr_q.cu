/* gpmpn_mu_divappr_q, gpmpn_preinv_mu_divappr_q.

   Compute Q = floor(N / D) + e.  N is nn limbs, D is dn limbs and must be
   normalized, and Q must be nn-dn limbs, 0 <= e <= 4.  The requirement that Q
   is nn-dn limbs (and not nn-dn+1 limbs) was put in place in order to allow us
   to let N be unmodified during the operation.

/*
   The idea of the algorithm used herein is to compute a smaller inverted value
   than used in the standard Barrett algorithm, and thus save time in the
   Newton iterations, and pay just a small price when using the inverted value
   for developing quotient bits.  This algorithm was presented at ICMS 2006.
*/

/* CAUTION: This code and the code in mu_div_qr.c should be edited in sync.

 Things to work on:

  * The itch/scratch scheme isn't perhaps such a good idea as it once seemed,
    demonstrated by the fact that the gpmpn_invertappr function's scratch needs
    mean that we need to keep a large allocation long after it is needed.
    Things are worse as gpmpn_mul_fft does not accept any scratch parameter,
    which means we'll have a large memory hole while in gpmpn_mul_fft.  In
    general, a peak scratch need in the beginning of a function isn't
    well-handled by the itch/scratch scheme.
